     I was unfortunately unable to personally attend the workshop but heard great things from a classmate of mine who was able to attend it.
     By the sound of it, The workshop delivered the base knowledge required for Github, version control and the likes.
     It was a commendable effort and I sincerely thank all the members of NUCS for making this event real and enjoyable for us.
